*Care for the people, care for the Earth.*

Our mission is to grow delicious, nutritious food for our community while growing produce in a way that heals and sustains the earth. We explore how regenerative agriculture can be a powerful climate solution as we move towards a fossil-free future. We work to uproot racism and inequality, while sowing seeds of solidarity, resilience, and peace.

Strawberry Dog Farm is a diverse growing operation that produces fresh vegetables, herbs, and flowers. We lease half an acre in Beverly, MA from New Entry Sustainable Farm Project. 

Strawberry Dog Farm started in 2023, growing on a quarter acre at New Entry in Beverly. We expanded to a half acre in 2024. 2025 will be our third growing season.
