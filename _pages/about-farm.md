***Care for the people. Care for the Earth.***

Our mission is to grow **delicious, nutritious food** for our community while growing produce in a way that heals and sustains the earth. We explore how **regenerative agriculture** can be a powerful climate solution as we move towards a **fossil-free future**. We work to uproot racism and inequality, while sowing seeds of **solidarity, resilience, and peace**.

Strawberry Dog Farm is a diverse growing operation producing fresh vegetables, herbs, and flowers. Located in Beverly, MA, we lease half an acre from the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project, an organization that supports new farmers in building sustainable, equitable food systems.

Since our start in 2023 on a quarter-acre plot, we’ve grown steadily—expanding to half an acre in 2024. As we head into our third growing season in 2025, we’re excited to continue deepening our roots in the community and the land.
