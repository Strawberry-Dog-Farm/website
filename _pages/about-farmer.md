Hi friends! I’m Laura, the founder of Strawberry Dog Farm.

My whole life, I’ve been enchanted by **the magic of plants**. Some of my favorite childhood memories involve growing things: “helping” my dad grow a giant watermelon, eating tiny spring onions straight from my grandmother’s garden, planting a sunflower in kindergarten that grew so tall we had to chop it down with an ax.

While thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail with my now-husband in 2019, I experienced the healing power of nature firsthand. I knew when we finished that I needed to find a way to include more nature in my everyday life.

Later, I found the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project, which allowed me to try my hand at farming on a quarter-acre lot in Beverly, MA, in 2023. I’m now going into my third year, growing on a half-acre. I couldn’t have done it without the help of my incredible family and friends, particularly my husband Joe. I’m so excited to see what this season has in store for us.
