Weâ€™re so excited to announce our Cut-Flower CSA, launching this July! Every other week, youâ€™ll receive a beautiful, organically grown bouquet straight from our farm to your home. Whether youâ€™re treating yourself or gifting someone special, itâ€™s the perfect way to celebrate summerâ€™s abundance.

Hereâ€™s what you can look forward to:

âœ¨ Price: $130

âœ¨ Duration: 4 weeks (every other weekâ€”because our bouquets are designed to last longer than 7 days!)

âœ¨ Start Date: Mid-July through late August

âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Included: A fresh, handpicked bouquet every other weekâ€”never the same arrangement twice!

âœ¨ Pickup Options: Revival Cafe in Davis Square, Winter Hill Brewing Company

(Have a suggestion for another pickup location in the Greater Boston area? Weâ€™d love to hear it! Email laura@strawberrydogfarm.com.)

As we daydream about summer blooms during these dreary winter days, weâ€™re already planning the vibrant colors and fragrant flowers weâ€™ll be growing just for you. And hereâ€™s where you come in: buying early is a huge help to us! Youâ€™re literally providing seed money to make all this hard work possible.

As a thank-you for your early support, weâ€™re offering an Early Bird Special until April 15th:

ðŸŒ» Price: $117 for the full share (thatâ€™s 10% off!)

But waitâ€”thereâ€™s more! To celebrate the launch, weâ€™re raffling off one free CSA share! Hereâ€™s how to enter:

Sign up for our email list (we promise weâ€™ll be too busy farming to flood your inbox).

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re entered.

Deadline to enter: April 1st at 11:59 PM EST.

If you win the raffle but have already purchased a CSA share, youâ€™ll be reimbursed.

Donâ€™t miss out on this chance to bring a little extra beauty into your summerâ€”and maybe even snag a free share! Letâ€™s grow something beautiful together.

With excitement and gratitude,

Laura
